# Hey there! 👋

I'm Maciej Kobus 🤓, known as **webhdx** on the interwebs. I've been devoted to PHP for more than 15 years now. By day I code **PHP** as **Senior Software Engineer** at [@ibexa](https://github.com/ibexa). I spend most of my evenings tinkering with electronics.

## 🧑‍🚀 My key skills and interests are:
* PHP 8.1
* Symfony framework
* Ibexa DXP (formerly eZ Platform)

## 👍 Do you like my work?
It's getting more and more difficult for me to find time for hobby projects. If you'd like to support my work consider becoming a sponsor 💵 here on GitHub or buy from my Tindie store: https://www.tindie.com/webhdx
